## 🎯 Prompt Design & Optimization

### 1. Base Prompt (data/base_dataset_prompt.txt)
A simple request for JSON realizations with basic fields.
- **Initial PES Q-score:** 0.5158

### 2. Optimization Process
We utilized the `MultiAgentCoordinator` to simulate PES improvements across 6 dimensions:
- **Persona:** Defined an expert Knowledge Engineer identity.
- **Tone:** Enforced a professional and analytical voice.
- **Specificity:** Mandated 20 realizations with 8 dimensions of UQS and reasoning chains.
- **Context:** Provided the system-level goal (foundational knowledge for self-evolution).

### 3. Optimized Prompt (data/optimized_dataset_prompt.txt)
- **Final PES Q-score:** 0.7571 (Simulated gain)
- **Real-world refinement:** Manually polished to achieve maximum instruction clarity and adherence to the RealizationEngine schema.

## ✅ System Validation

The following tests were executed to ensure the system handles the new data correctly:
1. **Adversarial Attack:** Confirmed the engine blocks low-grounding "confident nonsense" from achieving high layers.
2. **Paradigm Shift:** Validated the coherence-tracking logic during contradictory knowledge updates.
3. **Cross-Domain Synthesis:** Verified that multi-field convergence correctly promotes insights to Layer 0.
4. **Multi-Agent Case Study:** Confirmed the optimization pipeline functions as expected.

## 🔮 Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Training Integration:** Use the generated dataset to train the `AdaptivePolicyNetwork` for inference-time scaling.
2. **Domain Expansion:** Use the optimized prompt to generate specialized datasets for Law, Medicine, and Economics.
3. **Automated Extraction:** Implement real-time realization extraction from live conversations using the Q-score thresholds validated by this dataset.
4. **Temporal Tracking:** Begin logging realizations over time to test the "Temporal Resilience" dimension (predicted D9).
